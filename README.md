# TyperTool
An example CLT using [Typer](https://github.com/Samasaur1/Typer)

## Installation

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
```bash
brew install Samasaur1/core/typer
```

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)
```bash
mint install github_name/repo_name
```

### [Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon)
```bash
marathon install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samasaur1/TyperTool/master/Sources/TyperTool/main.swift /usr/local/bin/typer
```

While all of these methods will work, they will overlap, so only use one.

Mint and Marathon require that Swift 4.0 or greater be installed, but they will by nature be supported *instantaneously* as new versions come out.

Homebrew does not require anything, but there may be some time until newer versions are available on it.
